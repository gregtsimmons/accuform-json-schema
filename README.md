Acroform JSON Schema

This JSON Schema was created to capture PDF Acroform information from an existing PDF with an interactive form (A.K.A Acroform).  

The initial version of acroform.json.schemaincludes/covers the entire Acroform schema.  
Subsequent versions of acroform.json.schema are reduced in scope to inclulde only the parts of the Acroform schema that are useful and map to existing parts of the PrizmDoc form definition for the eSignature tool.
